This category includes all brittle to ductile style structures along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single 'planar' brittle or ductile surface to a fault system comprised of 10's of strands of both brittle and ductile nature. This structure may have some significant thickness (a deformation zone) and have an associated body of deformed rock that may be considered a DeformationUnit (Definition from GeoSciML model - see http://www.geosciml.org/geosciml/2.0/doc/GeoSciML/GeologicStructure/Shea...).\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn individual fault feature in a Quaternary fault data set is defined by a unique combination of name, URI, geologic history, slip, and orientation properties, as well as the inference that it represents a physically connected surface in the Earth. For mapped active or recently active faults, which are the scope of this scheme, the deformation style is assumed to be brittle (as opposed to ductile).&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n", "versions": [{"sld_file_path": null, "version": "1.1", "xsd_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/active-faultquaternary-fault/1.1/ActiveFault1.1.xsd", "date_created": "2012-12-17", "layers_info": {"ActiveFault": [{"optional": true, "type": "int", "name": "OBJECTID", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "FeatureURI", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "Name", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "FullName", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "ParentFeatureURI", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "Label", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "Description", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "Symbol", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "OtherID", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "SpecificationURI", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "FeatureType", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "GeologicHistory", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "RepresentativeAgeURI", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "YoungerAgeURI", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "OlderAgeURI", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "IntervalSinceMovement", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "ObservationMethod", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "double", "name": "PositionAccuracyMeters", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "PositionAccuracy", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "Displacement", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "SlipRate", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "SlipAccumulationInterval", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "MovementType", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "MovementSense", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "DipDirection", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "DateMostRecentEvent", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "RecurrenceInterval", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "TotalSlip", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "Source", "description": null}, {"optional": true, "type": "string", "name": "MetadataURI", "description": null}, {"optional": false, "type": "MultiCurvePropertyType", "name": "Shape", "description": null}]}, "xls_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/active-faultquaternary-fault/1.1/ActiveFaultTemplate1.1.xls", "uri": "http://stategeothermaldata.org/uri-gin/aasg/xmlschema/activefault/1.1", "sample_wfs_request": ""}, {"sld_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/active-faultquaternary-fault/1.2/ActiveFaults.sld", "version": "1.2", "xsd_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/active-faultquaternary-fault/1.2/ActiveFaults.xsd", "date_created": "2012-12-18", "layers_info": {"ActiveFault": [{"optional": true, "type": "int", "name": "OBJECTID", "description": "Integer record count, added by ArcGIS servers during service deployment; not required but cannot be removed when deploying from ArcGIS feature class\u2026  Not user maintained, so this element appears in XML implementation but not in the WellHeaderTemplate."}, {"optional": false, "type": "string", "name": "FeatureURI", "description": "Unique identifier that specifies the feature represented: e.g. a geologic feature, aquifer or facility structure.

This becomes problematic in the continuum from single temperature measurements to a discrete log with measures every 100\u2019 to a continuous temperature log; it\u2019s sort of arbitrary when one switches from the individual temperature measure as being the observation to the \u2018log view\u2019 in which the series of measures is the observation result (currently represented as an excel spreadsheet or LAS file)\u2014based mostly on what we think will be most useful to our customers.</span>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\t<o:p>\r\n\t</o:p>\r\n</p>\r\n", "versions": [{"sld_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/borehole-temperature-observation/1.5/BoreholeTemperature.zip", "version": "1.5", "xsd_file_path": "http://schemas.usgin.org/files/borehole-temperature-observation/1.5/BoreholeTemperature.xsd", "date_created": "2012-12-18", "layers_info": {"BoreholeTemperature": [{"optional": true, "type": "int", "name": "OBJECTID", "description": "Integer record count, added by ArcGIS servers during service deployment; not required but cannot be removed when deploying from ArcGIS feature class.

A generic model is intended to allow for oil, gas, or water injection (negative flow). The focus of this observation type is on injection (any fluid flowed into well) or disposal. Because of the wide variety of possible flow measurements (commodities, aggregation type), the model adopts a thin approach, which may result in many records being returned for a single well.

It is separate to, but harmonized with, GeoSciML and conforms to the level 0 of the Simple Features Profile for GML (link). Labels will be 'free-text' fields that will be, in robust services, well-structured summaries of complex GeoSciML data, while the representative thematic properties will be URIs of concepts in a controlled vocabulary. There may also be links, via identifier URIs, to full GeoSciML representations of the geologic features.

These features are essentially geographically located descriptions of outcrop to map scale units of rock--including lithologic composition, age, internal structure (bedding, foliation etc.) and genesis. The content model might be associated with map units on a geologic map, individual polygons (on a map) or borehole intervals (in a stratigraphic log), or with point locations to describe outcrops in field data.
